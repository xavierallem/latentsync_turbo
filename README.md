## 🔥 Updates

- `2025/10/28`: Added Whisper audio encoder quantization (4-bit/8-bit) for memory efficiency, comprehensive results analysis with video outputs in `results/`, lip-sync improvement proof-of-concept, AWS deployment framework, and code cleanup (removed SageAttention). Updates by Allen.
- `2025/10/25`: Added community-supplied inference optimizations (scheduler safeguards, CLI telemetry logging, optional DDIM fallback) while keeping the upstream model unchanged. Full credit remains with the original LatentSync authors.
- `2025/06/11`: We released **LatentSync 1.6**, which is trained on 512 $\times$ 512 resolution videos to mitigate the blurriness problem. Watch the demo [here](docs/changelog_v1.6.md).

- `2025/03/14`: We released **LatentSync 1.5**, which **(1)** improves temporal consistency via adding temporal layer, **(2)** improves performance on Chinese videos and **(3)** reduces the VRAM requirement of the stage2 training to **20 GB** through a series of optimizations. Learn more details [here](docs/changelog_v1.5.md).

## 📖 Introduction

We present *LatentSync*, an end-to-end lip-sync method based on audio-conditioned latent diffusion models without any intermediate motion representation, diverging from previous diffusion-based lip-sync methods based on pixel-space diffusion or two-stage generation. Our framework can leverage the powerful capabilities of Stable Diffusion to directly model complex audio-visual correlations.

## 🏗️ Framework

<p align="center">
<img src="docs/framework.png" width=100%>
<p>

LatentSync uses the [Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper) to convert melspectrogram into audio embeddings, which are then integrated into the U-Net via cross-attention layers. The reference and masked frames are channel-wise concatenated with noised latents as the input of U-Net. In the training process, we use a one-step method to get estimated clean latents from predicted noises, which are then decoded to obtain the estimated clean frames. The TREPA, [LPIPS](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.03924) and [SyncNet](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/publications/2016/Chung16a/chung16a.pdf) losses are added in the pixel space.

## 📑 Open-source Plan

- [x] Inference code and checkpoints
- [x] Data processing pipeline
- [x] Training code

## 🔧 Setting up the Environment

Install the required packages and download the checkpoints via:

```bash
source setup_env.sh
```

If the download is successful, the checkpoints should appear as follows:

```
./checkpoints/
|-- latentsync_unet.pt
|-- whisper
|   `-- tiny.pt
```

Or you can download `latentsync_unet.pt` and `tiny.pt` manually from our [HuggingFace repo](https://huggingface.co/ByteDance/LatentSync-1.6)

## 🚀 Inference

Minimum VRAM for inference:

- **8 GB** with LatentSync 1.5
- **18 GB** with LatentSync 1.6

There are two ways to perform inference:

### 1. Gradio App

Run the Gradio app for inference:

```bash
python gradio_app.py
```

The app now saves output videos and metrics JSONs directly to the `results/` folder for easy access and analysis.

### 2. Command Line Interface

Run the script for inference:

```bash
./inference.sh
```

You can try adjusting the following inference parameters to achieve better results:

- `inference_steps` [20-50]: A higher value improves visual quality but slows down the generation speed.
- `guidance_scale` [1.0-3.0]: A higher value improves lip-sync accuracy but may cause the video distortion or jitter.
- `--use_dpm_solver`: Use DPM-Solver scheduler for faster inference (recommended).
- `--use_quantization`: Enable 8-bit quantization for the Whisper audio encoder to reduce memory usage (experimental, may affect quality).
- `--use_flash_attention`: Enable Flash Attention 2 for potential speed improvements.
- Telemetry: CLI and Gradio runs now emit JSON metrics (runtime, GPU/CPU memory) into `results/` for easier profiling during experiments.

For detailed performance analysis and comparisons, see [results/README.md](results/README.md).

## 🔄 Data Processing Pipeline

The complete data processing pipeline includes the following steps:

1. Remove the broken video files.
2. Resample the video FPS to 25, and resample the audio to 16000 Hz.
3. Scene detect via [PySceneDetect](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect).
4. Split each video into 5-10 second segments.
5. Affine transform the faces according to the landmarks detected by [InsightFace](https://github.com/deepinsight/insightface), then resize to 256 $\times$ 256.
6. Remove videos with [sync confidence score](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/publications/2016/Chung16a/chung16a.pdf) lower than 3, and adjust the audio-visual offset to 0.
7. Calculate [hyperIQA](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2020/papers/Su_Blindly_Assess_Image_Quality_in_the_Wild_Guided_by_a_CVPR_2020_paper.pdf) score, and remove videos with scores lower than 40.

Run the script to execute the data processing pipeline:

```bash
./data_processing_pipeline.sh
```

You should change the parameter `input_dir` in the script to specify the data directory to be processed. The processed videos will be saved in the `high_visual_quality` directory. Each step will generate a new directory to prevent the need to redo the entire pipeline in case the process is interrupted by an unexpected error.

## 🏋️‍♂️ Training U-Net

Before training, you should process the data as described above. We released a pretrained SyncNet with 94% accuracy on both VoxCeleb2 and HDTF datasets for the supervision of U-Net training. You can execute the following command to download this SyncNet checkpoint:

```bash
huggingface-cli download ByteDance/LatentSync-1.6 stable_syncnet.pt --local-dir checkpoints
```

If all the preparations are complete, you can train the U-Net with the following script:

```bash
./train_unet.sh
```

We prepared several UNet configuration files in the ``configs/unet`` directory, each corresponding to a specific training setup:

- `stage1.yaml`: Stage1 training, requires **23 GB** VRAM.
- `stage2.yaml`: Stage2 training with optimal performance, requires **30 GB** VRAM.
- `stage2_efficient.yaml`: Efficient Stage 2 training, requires **20 GB** VRAM. It may lead to slight degradation in visual quality and temporal consistency compared with `stage2.yaml`, suitable for users with consumer-grade GPUs, such as the RTX 3090.
- `stage1_512.yaml`: Stage1 training on 512 $\times$ 512 resolution videos, requires **30 GB** VRAM.
- `stage2_512.yaml`: Stage2 training on 512 $\times$ 512 resolution videos, requires **55 GB** VRAM.

Also remember to change the parameters in U-Net config file to specify the data directory, checkpoint save path, and other training hyperparameters. For convenience, we prepared a script for writing a data files list. Run the following command:

```bash
python -m tools.write_fileslist
```

## 🏋️‍♂️ Training SyncNet

In case you want to train SyncNet on your own datasets, you can run the following script. The data processing pipeline for SyncNet is the same as U-Net. 

```bash
./train_syncnet.sh
```

After `validations_steps` training, the loss charts will be saved in `train_output_dir`. They contain both the training and validation loss. If you want to customize the architecture of SyncNet for different image resolutions and input frame lengths, please follow the [guide](docs/syncnet_arch.md).

## 📊 Evaluation

You can evaluate the [sync confidence score](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/publications/2016/Chung16a/chung16a.pdf) of a generated video by running the following script:

```bash
./eval/eval_sync_conf.sh
```

You can evaluate the accuracy of SyncNet on a dataset by running the following script:

```bash
./eval/eval_syncnet_acc.sh
```

Note that our released SyncNet is trained on data processed through our data processing pipeline, which includes special operations such as affine transformation and audio-visual adjustment. Therefore, before evaluation, the test data must first be processed using the provided pipeline.
